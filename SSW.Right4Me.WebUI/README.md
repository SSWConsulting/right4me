# SSW Right4Me

Right4Me allows the community to share information about products and services that meet specific disability needs. 

## Background Story
Right4Me was built by SSW during the Microsoft Hack4Good event. Over two days, 14 teams, 
and around 70 people gathered at the University of NSW, in Sydney to explore the potential
of technology to help people living with a disability fulfil their potential.
